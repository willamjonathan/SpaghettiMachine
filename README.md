# SpaghettiMachine
## Background:
  For our final project, we were given the task to create a physics simulation. Therefore, our initial step was to brainstorm various scenarios for the simulation. Our lecturer, Ms. Seraphine, granted us the freedom to utilize any Python libraries as long as we could create a high-quality simulation. Despite the freedom, we opted to incorporate the concepts taught in our class this semester and decided to develop our project using VPython. 

  The spaghetti machine is an intriguing device inspired by the idea of a Rube Goldberg machine. Similar to a Rube Goldberg machine, the spaghetti machine is designed to accomplish a simple objective, which is to guide a ball through a series of maps and obstacles in a creative and intricate manner. The machine comprises a setup that includes maps featuring different layouts, along with strategically placed obstacles along the path that the ball will traverse.

  Within our spaghetti machine, we have incorporated four distinct maps that showcase varying layouts for the ball to navigate through. Additionally, we have implemented interactive buttons that grant users control over certain aspects of our project. Specifically, we have included "Gravity" buttons that enable users to manipulate the gravitational force. They have the ability to increase or decrease gravity, as well as utilize specific gravity settings such as Sun Gravity, Moon Gravity, and Earth Gravity. Furthermore, we have integrated buttons that allow users to manipulate the wind direction, providing options to generate wind blowing to the left or to the right.
